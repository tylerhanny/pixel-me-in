# Pixel Me In: Save Your RAM

**Put your face in a 2D pixel-art runner game – and save your RAM from the data center.** Take a selfie (or upload a photo), watch it turn into pixels, then run across your desk and through a data center, grabbing every stick of RAM before _The Utilizer_ (a made-up cartoon villain) does.

▶️ **Play free: https://play.madhavkwatra.in**

_Parody: a fan-made joke game, not linked to or approved by any company or person. See [About](about.html)._

🔒 **Your photo never leaves your device.** Face detection runs in your browser. There is no server and no upload. [How we make sure of that →](docs/PRIVACY.md)

## Features

- 📸 **Camera or upload** – or skip the photo and pick a ready-made character
- 🧑‍🎨 **On-device pixel filter** – pixel size, colour palettes, outline, or keep the photo look
- 🎩 **Photo Booth** – hats, masks, glasses, outfits; save or share a picture of your character
- 🏃 **Zone Run** – endless runner, a new world every 180 m, robot chase before each zap
- ⚡ **Power-ups** – shield, gear magnet, jetpack
- 📱 **Works everywhere** – keyboard, touch and gamepad; installable app (PWA) that plays offline
- ♿ **Accessible** – reduce-motion and slow-mode options, screen-reader announcements, keyboard menus
- 🛠️ **Debug view** – add `?debug` to the URL (or enter the Konami code on the menu) to see hitboxes and FPS

## Run it locally

Needs Node.js 20+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MadhavKwatra/pixel-me-in.git
cd pixel-me-in
npm install        # also copies the MediaPipe runtime into public/mediapipe/wasm
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5190
```

| Command           | What it does                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Dev server with hot reload                        |
| `npm run build`   | Type-check + production build into `dist/`        |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build                        |
| `npm test`        | Unit tests (Vitest)                               |
| `npm run e2e`     | Browser smoke tests (Playwright, desktop + phone) |
| `npm run lint`    | ESLint                                            |
| `npm run icons`   | Re-draw icons and the social preview image        |

Dev review tools (need `npm run dev` running; output in `test-results/`): `node scripts/play-check.mjs`, `node scripts/ui-check.mjs`, `node scripts/preview-sprites.mjs`, `node scripts/likeness-gallery.mjs <photo-folder>`.

The camera needs HTTPS or `localhost`.

### Test on your phone (same Wi-Fi)

```bash
npm run dev:phone   # https://<your-PC-IP>:5191 (self-signed HTTPS, so the camera works)
```

Open the "Network" link on your phone. The first time, the browser warns "not private" (self-signed certificate): choose Advanced → Proceed. Windows may ask to allow Node.js on private networks. Installing the app (PWA) needs a real certificate, so test that after deploying.
