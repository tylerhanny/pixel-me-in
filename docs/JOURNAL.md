# Dev journal

Newest first. What changed, why, and what broke.

## 2026-11-05 – Readable encounters and a shorter first journey

- Five seeded road phrases replace origin-only random spawning: vault, duck, two jumps, duck-to-jump, and a safe RAM lane with an optional high trail. Spacing includes the entire phrase plus recovery. A visible-road speed cap reserves 1.05 seconds of approach on portrait and wide screens.
- Desk and Data Center now alternate every 180 m. Robot warnings arrive in an ordinary short run, teach laser before bomb, wait for existing hazards to clear and leave recovery between attacks. Jetpack protection extends through touchdown.
- Practice runs at normal speed, is skippable/replayable, and distinguishes a missed lesson from a successful pass. New normal and slow-mode records are separate; historical totals and earned unlocks remain.
- Rendered testing caught a regression: Phaser periodically emits resize with unchanged dimensions. Rotation cleanup now checks dimensions before releasing inputs or clearing attacks; the browser suite holds Slide beyond that refresh interval.

## 2026-11-05 – Controls and collision foundation

- Fresh touch players get on-press Jump/Slide buttons; explicit saved choices remain. Pointer cancellation, lost capture, pause and rotation release held inputs. Quick play uses a preset without downloading face models.
- Runtime inspection confirmed the Desk headset body ended above the standing player. Both slide hazards now overlap standing and clear sliding; pooled texture changes reset body geometry. Actual keyboard collision checks covered headset, drone, mug, cooling unit and crate.
- Gameplay deadlines now use accumulated active time, so pausing preserves warnings and protection. Bombs land at a visible target before scrolling. Robot following, magnet attraction and jetpack easing use elapsed time.
- Both analytics integrations require explicit build-time opt-in (`VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true`); fork builds omit upstream canonical identity. Original attribution remains.
- Baseline: lint, 56 unit tests, build and 13 browser tests passed (3 device-specific skips). Added real-input browser coverage for quick play, jumps, fast fall, swipe, cancellation and pause. Gameplay captures remain local review artifacts.

## 2026-11-04 – Offline Photo Booth on install

- Owner: the installed app should work fully offline, Photo Booth included. New `src/face/offline.ts` puts the exact MediaPipe files this device needs (SIMD or not, via `FilesetResolver`) into the service worker's `mediapipe` cache: automatically on `appinstalled`, when the installed app opens online without them (iPhone, earlier installs), and from Settings → Offline → "Download (17 MB)". Skipped when the phone's data saver is on.
- Tested with a production build: after the install event, and after the Settings button, a brand-new photo works with the browser offline.
- Owner also saw a white game screen (sound only) in the installed app on their phone (offline). Not reproducible on PC. Cause: the installed app already runs full screen, and `enterGameMode` asked for element fullscreen again. Skipping it in the installed app (`isStandalone()`) fixed it – owner confirmed on the phone after the update.

## 2026-11-04 – Gestures by default; offline checked

- Owner: phones should play with touch gestures by default. `touchButtons` now defaults to `never`; a new `touchButtonsChosen` flag keeps a player's own choice, and old saves with the old default `auto` switch to gestures. The tutorial chip and the pause menu can still turn the buttons on. Unit-tested (`tests/settings.test.ts`).
- Offline check (production build + service worker, browser set offline): landing, menu, a NEW photo through MediaPipe, Photo Booth, a run and all detail pages work – once the face finder was used online one time (it is cached on first use, ~17 MB, not precached on install).
- Found and fixed: on the very first visit the service worker did not control the page yet, so a first photo did not cache MediaPipe. `clientsClaim: true` fixes it (updates still wait for the player).

## 2026-11-04 – Launch marketing pack

- Researched first: Reels safe zone (Meta: keep text out of the top ~270 px, the bottom ~670 px and the right-side buttons), hooks (action or a face change in the first 2 s, no logo first), 4:5 carousels with a strong first slide, and hashtag counts per platform.
- `scripts/promo-images.mjs`: the "everything" post, a 5-slide carousel, a story with room for the link sticker, an X/LinkedIn image and a before/after. Drawn in the page from the real game art and the owner's face (the game's own pipeline and face detector).
- `scripts/promo-reel.mjs`: an 18.2 s Reel (40 beats at 132 BPM, so the music loops cleanly). Selfie → pixel art hook, a booth montage (1 beat per look), the zap, RAM, an 8 GB RGB stick, a milestone, the beam (slow motion), a cloud drop jump, "He grabbed X GB!", "Utilized!", an end card that fades to white into the loop. Three recordings (booth, run on autopilot, a clean music bed); a white flash + shutter sound lines up picture and sound; every game sound and event is logged with its time, so the cut finds the moments by itself (and records again if the rare RGB stick did not show). Captions sit inside the safe zone.
- `scripts/promo-lib.mjs`: helpers shared with `promo-video.mjs`.
- Owner: landscape looks better on Threads, X and LinkedIn. `promo-reel.mjs --landscape` makes a 1920×1080 version of the same cut: recorded on a 960×540 desktop screen (booth side by side, more road), the selfie as a framed print with the caption beside it, captions over the sky or in a bottom band, and an end card that says "Your photo never leaves your device" instead of "link in bio". The wide run is faster (portrait runs 10 % slower), so the autopilot lets go earlier to keep the crash inside the Robot Rush.
- Owner: "everything happens fast". Now 60 beats (~27 s, still loops): the selfie holds 2 beats, 1.5 beats per booth look, no speed-ups, a longer end card. One table of beat lengths (`B`) drives both the shots and the captions. `--reuse --redraw` redraws frames and captions without recording again.
- Owner: the sound "randomly restarts" and does not feel well made. Causes: (1) each shot carried its own clip of recorded game sound, so sounds were cut off and restarted at every cut; (2) the robot stomps played off the beat; (3) single-pass loudnorm pumped the volume; (4) the music bed and the recordings were found by the recorder clock, which was ~5 s off, and the search fell back to that clock without saying so (the music started mid-song and stopped 5 s early). Now the sound track is played again, clean, on the final timeline: one pass of the music, one pass of every game sound at its moment (booth clicks on the beat, the game-over jingle added, robot stomps left out). The passes are found by their pattern (pause, music, pause, mark), not by the clock. Fixed levels (music -20, sounds -22 LUFS), a two-pass linear loudnorm and a low limiter: about -16 LUFS, peaks under -3 dB.
- Owner: the booth part felt long; it only needs to show that you can dress up. Now 4 looks (Cartoon, Cap, Sunglasses, Space suit), 2 beats each, picked by label from the booth recording. 68 beats (~31 s, 17 whole bars).
- Owner, again: still too fast, and the booth zooming in and out between looks felt random. Now 80 beats (~36 s, 20 bars = 5 rounds of the song): the selfie holds 3 beats, 2.5 beats (1.1 s) per booth look with one steady framing (the booth was recorded again with 1.5 s between looks), ~1.8 s per gameplay moment, longer slow motion, a 6 s end card. `--reuse --booth` records only the booth again.
- Owner: "No install" was wrong (the game can be installed as an app). Checked every text: now "No install needed", "made on your device" (not "phone"), "No account needed", "Free to play. Open source." (not "Private": there are anonymous play stats), "I turned my selfie into a game character", "The Utilizer wants your RAM!". The post texts no longer say "No server".
- Bug found on the way: some pieces had sound longer than the picture (the `atrim` cut did not hold), and the join stretched those shots, so captions drifted up to ~0.3 s. Each piece now gets a hard `-t` stop.

## 2026-11-04 – Search engines, stats check, link previews

- Owner set up Google Search Console (Domain property `madhavkwatra.in`, DNS TXT at Netlify DNS – checked it resolves) and Bing Webmaster Tools (import from Google; it imported the root site, so the `play.` sitemap may need its own entry).
- Vercel Web Analytics confirmed live: a test visit posted `/_vercel/insights/view` → 200. PostHog drops headless test visits as bots, as designed; real visits count.
- WhatsApp preview shows title, description and the new picture; its square crop cuts the title (centring it is offered).
- GitHub repo homepage + description now point to the live game.
- Marketing images + Reel moved to a new session (prompt given to the owner).

## 2026-11-04 – Live at play.madhavkwatra.in

- Deployed on Vercel from GitHub `main` (domain session set up the domain; DNS at Netlify DNS). Checked live: pages, MediaPipe files, headers, the `/ph` PostHog proxy and a full photo → booth → run on desktop + phone with 0 other hosts and 0 errors.
- SEO with the owner's yes: canonical + absolute `og:url`/`og:image` (+ size and alt) on all 4 pages, `twitter:image`, `url`/`image` in the JSON-LD, `public/sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` with the sitemap line (and `/ph/` disallowed).
- New social preview image drawn from the real game art by `scripts/og-image.mjs` (desk zone, the maker's character, RAM sticks, The Utilizer, title, address). `make-icons.mjs` no longer draws `og-image.png`.

## 2026-11-04 – Anonymous play stats

- Owner wants to see visits and how people play, without cookies. Added `src/analytics.ts`: Vercel Web Analytics (visits, referrers, devices) + PostHog (US region, owner's pick) in `cookieless_mode: 'always'` with memory persistence (daily-rotating server hash for unique visitors). A fixed event list with rough ranges (distance, GB), never image/face/name data.
- Both go through our own domain (`/_vercel/insights`, `/ph` rewrite in `vercel.json`), so the CSP stays `connect-src 'self'`. Checked with a production build and a fake key: events go to `/ph/e/`, 0 cookies, 0 other hosts, 0 CSP errors. PostHog drops headless browsers as bots (good for our tests and videos).
- Off in dev, in automated browsers, with Do Not Track / Global Privacy Control, without `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`, and via Settings → "Share anonymous play stats". The PostHog chunk (~116 KB gzip) loads after the page is ready.

## 2026-11-04 – New theme: "Save Your RAM"

- Owner's idea, riding a real news moment (OpenAI's CEO on idle RAM in home PCs, late Oct 2026). Researched first: what was actually said (he did not say people can't own RAM), the RAM shortage, and parody law (caricature + joke name; no real photo, name, logos or fake quotes). Owner picked: caricature mech, name "Pixel Me In: Save Your RAM", fast release today, replace zones now (old ones kept).
- RAM sticks replace gears (1 GB / 8 GB RGB), GB counter, milestone toasts, RAM grab on a stumble, power-ups renamed, "Utilized!" game over, share texts in GB.
- The Utilizer: our finished robot body with a cartoon CEO in a glass dome. The old antenna would have stuck out of the sprite, so the dome has a small blinking light instead.
- New zones Your Desk and Data Center (pure art data in `world.ts`; the engine did not change). `ZoneArt.clouds` replaces the "no clouds in space" special case.
- Pages: landing copy, How to play, About ("Why RAM?" with one accurate sentence + link to the news, and a parody note), footer note, PWA manifest, README.

## 2026-11-04 – Bomb fix; the repo goes public

- Bug: the thrown bomb did not land on its red ring. The flying bomb tweened to a fixed spot guessed once (`speed × time × 0.6`) while the ring scrolled with the world, and the arc ended 80 px above the ground. Now the bomb's position is set every frame from the ring's live position (`bombArc` in `rules.ts`, unit-tested) and it lands on the ground exactly on the ring.
- Demo autopilot: jumps bomb rings, and pooled obstacles forget an old "already jumped" flag.
- Before going public, checked the whole git history: no emails (commits use the GitHub noreply address), no local paths, no keys, no photos except the owner-approved pixel character. The game makes no network requests (`connect-src 'self'`; only links and the phone's own share menu).
- Repo link (`REPO_URL`) shown on About ("Code on GitHub", "How to help", "Report a bug"), Privacy (links `docs/PRIVACY.md`), footer, Settings. README has clone steps.

## 2026-11-02 – The real cause of the vanishing face in videos

- Owner: in the landscape video the face still disappeared while running (the earlier blink/autopilot fix was not the cause).
- Found with frame-by-frame close-ups: the head sprite was visible, full size and fully opaque, yet often not drawn (sometimes half drawn). With one texture per batch (`maxTextures: 1`) it never happened; on the real GPU (NVIDIA, D3D11) it never happened either. Cause: software WebGL (SwiftShader, used by headless Chromium) samples the wrong texture in Phaser's multi-texture batch. The vertical video was lucky.
- Fix: the game checks the WebGL renderer name at start; on software renderers (SwiftShader, llvmpipe, "software", Microsoft Basic Render) it uses one texture per batch. Normal GPUs keep the fast path.
- The video recorder now runs Chromium on the GPU, finds the end card in the picture (scene change) to line up the sound (< 0.05 s off), and limits peaks lower (AAC overshoots on square waves).

## 2026-11-02 – Demo videos with sound; touch buttons toggle

- **Touch buttons on/off in the run**: the Pause menu has the "Touch buttons" option (Upright only / Always / Never), and during the tutorial a "Hide buttons / Show buttons" chip sits next to Pause. Both change the pad at once (`setPadShown`, `updatePad` in `touchControls.ts`).
- **Photo Booth music**: a calm chiptune loop while you dress up (follows the Music setting).
- **Videos reworked** (`scripts/promo-video.mjs`), owner feedback "text covers the UI, no sound feels bad, skip the landing page":
  - Start in the Photo Booth (styles, colours, hats, glasses, outfits), then the zap, the run, Robot Rush, game over, and an end card "Would you play this? Tell me in the comments!".
  - Captions sit in an 80 px band above the game (ffmpeg `pad` + `drawtext` with the Pixelify font), never on top of it.
  - Sound: an init script copies every Web Audio output into a MediaRecorder; ffmpeg adds it with loudness normalised. The recording only starts with the first sound, so the clock offset was ~1 s off; the end-card sound after the quiet game-over screen is now the sync marker (measured: < 0.1 s off).
  - Landscape zooms the booth ×1.35 so it fills the frame.
- Fix: when the demo autopilot ended mid-slide, the slide was never released (the character slid on for 40 s). Players never use the autopilot.

## 2026-11-02 – Stumble is final; video fixes

- Owner picked **Stumble + catch-up**; the "Attacks only" design and the Settings test switch are removed.
- After a stumble the character blinks at 65 % (was 40 %) and slower: at 40 % the face looked like it disappeared, especially in compressed video.
- Demo autopilot keeps sliding until a high obstacle is fully behind it (it stood up too early and stumbled in the landscape video).

## 2026-11-02 – v0.3 part G: promo videos

- `scripts/promo-video.mjs` records the real game with captions: landing → photo → cut-out → Photo Booth looks → run → Robot Rush → pixel crash → share sheet → end card. Landscape 1280×720 and vertical 1080×1920 (recorded at 540×960, scaled ×2 with crisp pixels), converted to MP4 with ffmpeg. Output in `promo/videos/` (git-ignored: it shows the owner's face).
- Demo mode for recordings: `?demo&start=372&autopilot=15` – starts near the first Robot Rush, a simple autopilot dodges for 15 s, no fullscreen, no tips. Never on for players.
- No sound in the videos (browser recordings are silent) – fixed later the same day (see above).

## 2026-11-02 – v0.3 part D: the maker on the landing page

- `scripts/creator-variants.mjs` renders 8 looks from the owner's local photo (never committed); the owner picked "Pixel · T-shirt".
- `--export 1` wrote the 8 run frames (pixel art only, 7 KB) to `public/brand/creator-run.png`; the landing tablet plays them with the caption "That's me, Madhav – the maker. Your turn!" (fallback: a ready-made character).
- Mini scene now takes ready frames (`characterFrames`, `sliceSheet`).
- Hats sit a little lower (into the hair).

## 2026-11-02 – v0.3 part F: share to socials

- Share sheet (`src/ui/shareSheet.ts`) on game over ("Challenge friends") and in the Photo Booth: phone share menu with the picture (Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat …), X, Threads, WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Copy link, and "Save the picture" in story (1080×1920) or square size.
- Share cards (`src/ui/shareCard.ts`) use the pixel font, show the score + "Can you beat me?" and the game link.
- Challenge links: `?beat=1234` → landing shows "Your friend ran 1,234 m. Can you beat it?"; game over compares your run with your friend's.
- Only links – the game sends nothing. `scripts/share-check.mjs` screenshots the sheet and saves both cards.

## 2026-11-02 – v0.3 part C: the robot

- New robot sprite (`src/art/robot.ts`, shared helpers in `src/art/pixelGrid.ts`): 8-frame stomp, swinging arms, shoulder pads, scanning eye, blinking antenna, pulsing chest light, hazard stripe; laser, throw and zapped poses.
- Robot Rush (last 90 m of each zone): warned attacks instead of normal obstacles – laser (0.8 s blinking warning, slide under) and bomb (red ring where it lands, jump over). The robot is zapped away at the zone change.
- Two designs to compare (Settings → Robot (test)): **Stumble** (default: first crash trips you, the robot runs up behind you for 6 s, a second crash = caught) and **Attacks only** (one crash ends the run). Rules in `rules.ts`, unit-tested.
- Debug shortcut: `?debug&start=395` starts a run just before the first Robot Rush. `scripts/robot-check.mjs` screenshots it.

## 2026-11-02 – v0.3 part B: touch controls, full-screen portrait

- Gestures (`src/ui/gestures.ts`, unit-tested): tap anywhere or swipe up = jump, swipe down (hold) = slide / fast fall. One hand is enough.
- Optional Jump/Slide pad (`src/ui/touchControls.ts`); Settings → Touch buttons: Upright only (default) / Always / Never. Tutorial hints adapt and make the right button glow.
- The canvas now fills the whole screen at device pixel density; `src/game/view.ts` picks the camera: landscape shows more road on wide phones, portrait shows ~420 world px across with sky above and dirt below (ground ~64 % down). Portrait runs 10 % slower for reaction time.
- "Rotate your phone" block removed (no orientation lock); one tip on the first upright run.
- Photo Booth on phones: sticky small preview, one-row tabs, 3 thumbnails per row, sticky action bar.

## 2026-11-02 – v0.3 part A: pages, footer, feedback

- Phone header: Play button + ☰ menu (Esc / outside click closes); current page highlighted.
- Footer: "Made with ♥ by Madhav", icon links (Simple Icons, CC0), Feedback / Privacy; stays at the bottom of short pages.
- Landing on phones: title → tablet → Play order; sticky "Play now" bar once the hero button scrolls away.
- Title screen: link row removed, ✕ exit icon; Settings gets "More" (pages) and "Feedback & contact".
- Feedback & contact block (`src/ui/feedback.ts`): message me (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, portfolio), share the game; feedback form and GitHub links appear once `FEEDBACK_URL` / `REPO_URL` are set in `src/creator.ts`.
- Game over: "Enjoying it? Share the game" from the 3rd run.
- Toasts: close button, always auto-hide.
- `scripts/ui-check.mjs`: every page and screen at 360×740, 390×844, 412×915, 915×412 and 1280×800; warns about sideways overflow.
- Phone testing: `npm run dev:phone` (HTTPS on the Wi-Fi address, port 5191).

## 2026-11-01 – Phaser skills for AI helpers

- Copied Phaser's official agent skills (28 guides shipped in the phaser npm package, MIT) into `.claude/skills/phaser-*` with `npm run skills:phaser`. Prefixed with `phaser-` so generic names like "scenes" do not clash.
- Searched for other game skills: no official Anthropic game skill; community options (e.g. gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills: game-feel, audio-design) noted but not added.

## 2026-11-01 – v0.2 phase 4: UX/UI

- Short landing page: hero with a "tablet" showing a live mini scene, one Play button, 3 steps, 3 cards.
- Own pages: `how-to-play.html` (device-first controls), `privacy.html`, `about.html` (creator + credits). Shared header/footer from `partials/` via a tiny Vite plugin. Multi-page build; CSP on every page.
- Pixel font Pixelify Sans (OFL, self-hosted) for headings, buttons and HUD; readable system font for body text; sentence-case buttons.
- Title-screen menu with your character running; stats; links to Privacy/About.
- Photo Booth: tabs (Look, Hat, Face, Outfit, Character) with picture buttons, animated preview.
- Themed loading screens (running character + "digitizing" bar) when the game opens and while finding the face.
- Phones only see touch controls (in-game How to play, hints, game-over tip).
- Fixed: Photo Booth overflowed on phones; mini scene crashed when the first animation frame arrived "in the past".

## 2026-11-01 – v0.2 phases 2 + 3: game feel, tutorial, power-ups

**Game feel (phase 2)**

- New body drawn from a tiny skeleton (`src/art/body.ts`): 8-frame run, idle, jump, fall, land, slide, hurt; outlined and shaded; 5 outfits.
- Mario-style controls: jump buffer (130 ms), coyote time (90 ms), faster falling, floaty apex while jump is held, short hop.
- Juice: squash/stretch on the head, run dust, landing puffs, slide sparks, shadow, "+1" pops, speed lines, bobbing/wobbling obstacles, clouds, robot stomp dust.
- Crash: short hit-stop, then the character breaks into its own pixels ("de-digitize").
- "Ready… GO!" start. Chiptune music per zone (`src/audio/music.ts`), Music toggle in Settings.
- Pause button is bigger and shows "Esc" on keyboards.

**Teaching + balance (phase 3)**

- Interactive tutorial: jump → slide → double jump → grab a power-up. Time slows to 25 % near each lesson until the player does the move; touch screens glow on the side to tap, keyboards show the key.
- Power-ups: first one at 120 m, then at least one every 250 m (10 % chance per pattern in between). Unit-tested.

**Dev tools**

- `scripts/preview-sprites.mjs`, `scripts/play-check.mjs`, `scripts/contact-sheet.mjs`.

## 2026-11-01 – v0.2 phase 1b: fewer, better looks

- Owner test: only Fine (48 px) looked like them. Faces at 16–24 px lose identity, so the size picker is gone.
- Looks: **Pixel** (48 px), **Cartoon** (new: smoothed, 9 flat colours, ink lines, feature boost), **Photo**.
- Pause: could not reproduce "no pause screen" (button, Esc and P all work); added an e2e test. The VS Code browser may keep Esc for itself.

## 2026-11-01 – v0.2 phase 1: likeness + head cut-out

**Changed**

- Face Detector → **Face Landmarker** (478 points) + **selfie Image Segmenter**, both self-hosted.
- Head cut-out: person mask, minus everything below the jawline and beside it (no neck, shoulders or background). Toggle in the crop screen.
- Crop now fits the visible head, so the face fills the square.
- New pixel filter: colours picked from the photo (k-means in Lab), stray-pixel cleanup, and a **feature boost** that redraws pupils, brows, mouth and nose at small sizes.
- Pixel sizes: Retro 16 / Classic 24 / Fine 48 (Chunky removed). Default: Fine, Natural colours.
- Hats and glasses now fit each head (placed from the saved eye/head positions).
- Live "In the game" preview in the crop screen.
- `scripts/likeness-gallery.mjs`: screenshots every look for a folder of test photos.

**Why**

- Owner feedback: only Fine looked like them; the neck and wall showed inside a circle.

## 2026-10-26 – v0.1.0, first playable

**Built**

- Vite + TypeScript + Phaser 4 project, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright.
- Photo pipeline: upload / camera / ready-made characters → MediaPipe face detection (self-hosted) → level crop with manual adjust → on-device pixel filter → IndexedDB.
- Photo Booth: look, pixel size, palettes, outline, 5 hats, 4 face accessories, 5 outfits, unlocks, save/share picture.
- Zone Run: 4 zones, robot chase, 3 power-ups, tutorial, double jump, short hop, slide, fast fall.
- HTML landing page with SEO tags, JSON-LD, how to play, privacy section.
- PWA (installable, offline), strict CSP, debug overlay, reduced-motion + slow mode.
- All art and sound generated in code. Icons/OG image from `scripts/make-icons.mjs`.

**Decisions**

- No AI image generation: on-device filter is free, instant and private.
- HTML for menus, canvas only for gameplay (accessibility + SEO).
- TypeScript 6.0 instead of 7.0, because typescript-eslint does not support 7 yet.
- Playwright pinned to 1.63 to reuse an already-installed Chromium build.

**Bugs found and fixed**

- Click handlers piled up when switching screens → each screen now gets a fresh element.
- Icon generator wrote colour bytes at fractional offsets → coordinates are now rounded.
- Tutorial hint covered the first obstacle → moved up.
- Crop screen shade darkened the whole panel → clipped to the crop box.
- MediaPipe logs `INFO:` lines as console errors → ignored in e2e tests.
